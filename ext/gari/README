Gari is a simple, fast, cross platform game library targeted at 2D games, 
written in plain C. For now, it uses SDL as a backend, but that might change later to use more low-level back-ends. It's goals are: 

* Targeted to make writing 2D games as easy as possible.
* A simple API, that hides the details as much as possible.
* Fast, giving good performance everywhere possible.
* Cross platform. Enough said.
* Complete. All you need to write games, but nothing more.
* Release under Zlib license (or similar permissive).
* Easy to embed in Ruby. 


Gari works on MRI 1.9.x (1.8.x untested) and Rubinius 1.2 (tested)


Rationale for creating Gari for use with the Eruta project:
 
* In Eruta'm also wrapping SDL, in another layer, and then using this for tile maps, etc. Needless to say that this is all not very fast. To speed up things, I have to implement some lower level functionality in C. 

* I could wrap this low level functionality directly from Ruby as is done by e.g. Starruby, but I feel this library could aslo be useful wrapped in other languages, like OOC, the Go Language, python, or even C++ (yuck).
    
* I could mix-and match, only implement the functionality that SDL misses, and still wrap SDL directly using rubysdl, but that means that in ruby I have to 
keep all sorts of dependencies. I'm using SGE for doing 2d drawing, which creates additional dependencies. It would be easiest if I has a single C library for game programming that I could wrap easily in Ruby.

* I'm planning to embed Ruby in C anyway, to make distributing the executable easier (in stead of doing the opposite). Might as well implement the essential low level functionality in C.
    
Disadvantages of this project:
 
* A lot of time consuming programming in C that does not directly help with the Eruta game being built. I've spent already a lot of time on writing "engine" layers, and not enough time on writing the game itself. 
  
Aside: why was I trying to wrap SDL in Go, essentially trying to create an
identical project like Gari in Go? This was also for the same core reason: more
performance. However, CGO is a letdown there, we still have to drop down to C 
for tile maps, etc. So why not use all C for the basic library, then?

The crucial point here is: performance, is it worth all the extra work? If it 
was a web application, then I'd say : no. But to allow people with old 
computers or nettops to play my games: I'd say, yes, it's worth while to give it 
a try at least.

How about using OpenGL for acelleration? The problem is that on Linux, OpenGL
is not always accelerated on older computers or nettops. Often it is a software
Mesa3D which is /slower/ than straight SDL functions. Allegro 5 suffert from 
this problem. I hope SDL 1.3 will solve the problem for me.
