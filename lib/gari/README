Gari is a simple, fast, cross platform game library, written in plain C.
For now, it uses SDL as a backend, but that might change later to use more low-level back-ends. It's goals are: 

* Targeted to make writing 2D games as easy as possible.
* A simple API, that hides the details as much as possible.
* Fast, giving good performance everywhere possible.
* Cross platform. Enough said.
* Complete. All you need to write games, but nothing more.
* Release under Zlib license (or similar permissive).
