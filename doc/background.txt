Myriads of years passed since man first set foot on the moon. Terrible wars raged, and great ecological problems arose. Much was destroyed, and the face of the Earth itself was changed. Finally, tired of the endless troubles, the people of the world united to build a durable era of cooperation, peace and prosperity. Technology developed as never before, and mankind traveled to the stars and spread throughout the galaxy. 

However, even this golden age of technology came to an end somehow. Contact with the other worlds was lost. The advanced technology and the great cities were abandoned, and mankind's numbers dwindled as they reverted to a more primitive lifestyle.  
Yet, when it looked like mankind was doomed to disappear, a mysterious event turned the tide yet again. The Great Tree sprang from the earth, bringing life and protection to all of mankind. It seeds spread throughout the continents, bringing forth the Twenty Lesser Trees.

The Numen, the power that flowed from these trees gave mankind new, Mysterious Powers that allowed them to heal and recover themselves and the land. Still, there are those who would abuse this power for their own selfish goals... That is why, everywhere a tree appeared, Protectors rose up to keep the Trees safe. 



[22:46:50] Bjorn: hey good evening to you
[22:47:18] Alex bond45: It's 3 O'Clock here
[22:47:43] Bjorn: yup, the earth is round. :)
[22:48:09] Alex bond45: Hmm, Just thought about the British Empire
[22:48:22] Bjorn: heh, yeah, when it was...
[22:48:28] Alex bond45: "The sun Never sets on the British Empire"
[22:48:33] Bjorn: yup
[22:49:08] Alex bond45: Anyway,
[22:49:20] Alex bond45: I was looking at the proposal,
[22:49:25] Bjorn: yes
[22:50:03] Alex bond45: Seems like it would work well
[22:50:09] Alex bond45: Futurisitic Ideas are always fun
[22:50:19] Alex bond45: You can do whatever the heck you want, make things up
[22:51:01] Bjorn: there is one thing I'd like to ask you thoough, and it's just because I had some problems with it before, ine I know you are religious and you probably know I am not. I don' tthink it 's aproblem, so I hope that's not one for you?
[22:51:29] Bjorn: some religious people refused to work with me before since I am not
[22:51:34] Alex bond45: As long as we don't stray onto that area of Conversation, I'll be OK
[22:53:01] Bjorn: That's ok, but for the plot, I have to precise this: since it's like 60k years in the future, none of the contemporary religions still exists in any recongnisable state. It got al garbles, mixed up, forgotte , reinterpreted, etc, ...
[22:53:16] Alex bond45: Well, There should be
[22:53:21] Bjorn: like most else of language, culture, politics, race, etc
[22:53:30] Bjorn: of course, the same ideas still persist
[22:53:33] Alex bond45: 1 Government, which attempts to maintain control of the Earth
[22:53:59] Alex bond45: However, There are several areas which have broken off, but the Goverment has it's own problems
[22:54:33] Bjorn: actually, the way I saw it, there are many, many small countries, eac with their own governments, however, they don't actually have much to do or to decie.
[22:54:38] Alex bond45: hmm
[22:55:10] Alex bond45: Being 60k yrs in the future, there should probably be a Galaxy wide Government
[22:55:34] Alex bond45: In the End, Humanity either goes 2 ways,
[22:55:36] Bjorn: well, actually, the game is set /after/ that decayed
[22:55:47] Alex bond45: mmm
[22:55:58] Bjorn: the 21 rtrees were an emergency system prepared for such an occurrence
[22:56:09] Alex bond45: Interesting
[22:56:48] Bjorn: so now the earth is isloated again. Also, I'm going for rathe rhard SF, meaning; no time travel, and no faster than ligh ttavel, and no teleportation of macroscopic objects.
[22:57:03] Alex bond45: aww
[22:57:12] Alex bond45: Doesn
[22:57:20] Bjorn: they travled to other plaets but in large, "gneration ships" ike the ones you see in phantasy star 3
[22:57:22] Alex bond45: 't help that I'm watching Star Trek right now
[22:57:36] Bjorn: so that's why it was hard to stay in touch
[22:58:04] Alex bond45: hmm, I'm thinking of Goverments
[22:58:12] Alex bond45: There should be a group of Japaneese
[22:58:37] Alex bond45: Men who control all the land that was the Holy Roman Empire
[22:58:48] Alex bond45: a group near Australia
[22:58:57] Alex bond45: A Large Americas Empire
[22:59:11] Alex bond45: and Several Asia States, that are constantly at war
[22:59:36] Bjorn: did I forhot to mention, geography wasalso changed a bit... due to human terraforming bu talso due to disasters.. :)
[22:59:50] Alex bond45: hmm
[23:00:12] Bjorn: and also, the idea is more of a "physical utopia"
[23:00:43] Bjorn: people don't lack anything physically, and also it's very hard to physically harm another person, so war and violence are purely virtual
[23:00:47] Alex bond45: There should also be Outskirts, where It's Absolute Hell compared to the main cities
[23:00:54] Bjorn: oh yes, tha twill be
[23:01:04] Alex bond45: The Resistance Groups or something
[23:01:17] Alex bond45: Kinda like Ravenholm
[23:01:28] Alex bond45: From Half Life 2
[23:01:55] Bjorn: Well, do you know the game Opoona?
[23:02:04] Alex bond45: No
[23:02:10] Bjorn: It's an interesting lillte RPG for the WII.
[23:02:10] Alex bond45: I usually play Strategy and Valve Games
[23:02:42] Alex bond45: I've played RPGs, but They are usually a Bit Frustrating, Except for Nintendo ones, because you actually gotta focus more
[23:02:59] Bjorn: it has a world where inside the cities everything is peaceful and orderly, it's sort of a utopia. And yet some people rejject it and go live smack dab between the beasts outside to escape it.
[23:03:49] Bjorn: Well, I'd like to make the battles hinge more on tactics, but with the exception that I don't like to move the characters around manually. In stead if you attack a beast, you'll move up closer (if using a hand-to-hand weapon).
[23:05:41] Bjorn: In Eruta and all civilised places in the world under the 21 trees, people are being pampered by their Andoids, who do all the work. And the Husk protects them against illness, and agression. And when there's a need, then theskilled can use the power of the trees, Numen to set things right.
[23:06:04] Alex bond45: I can see how the Main Antagonist will Attempt to win
[23:06:18] Alex bond45: He will send a command to all Androids to attack the Humans
[23:06:48] Bjorn: even meat grows from trees 365 years per day, so there's no economic ned as well. As a result, though.. most people just hang around their homes, playing with their androids or in a virtual world.
[23:07:01] Bjorn: Ah yes, androids...
[23:07:07] Bjorn: an mavericks
[23:08:17] Bjorn: All androids are programed to intensely desire to make humans happy. They are programmedto focus on physical means to arachieve this first. Liying and keeping the truth, though ,seems essential to keep people happy, so they do that as much as is needed.
[23:08:43] Bjorn: Mavericks are androids who lost that programming. Some are neutral, some hate humans.
[23:09:02] Alex bond45: Perhaps the Character should start out in the Military, it might make sense
[23:09:22] Bjorn: Well, there is no military , but there are hunters...
[23:09:39] Alex bond45: No military? Hmm
[23:09:41] Bjorn: who hunt mavericks, beasts, and the infection of omen...
[23:09:49] Alex bond45: Omen?
[23:09:58] Bjorn: the corrupted version of Numen
[23:10:18] Bjorn: Numen is, all in all, very advanced technology. it works very well, but... it also has bugs...
[23:10:33] Bjorn: of course, some popel don't understand it is even technology at all
[23:11:04] Bjorn: Omen is oppsed to numen, ike mavericks are oppposed (usually) to androids
[23:11:33] Bjorn: Well, no military at all would be a bit too extreme I guess
[23:12:00] Alex bond45: I'm sure most governments are Police States
[23:12:04] Bjorn: but let's say that it's like in japan: most countries just have apolice force that includes hunters
[23:12:57] Bjorn: The system of the 21 trees, the numen, and the androids was designed to kep people happy, and it wil do that whether they like it or not. It's the ultimate government
[23:13:17] Bjorn: the countries have ther own governments, bu ttey're largely symbolical
[23:13:19] Alex bond45: What if a tree is destroyed?
[23:13:34] Bjorn: then one of the other trees produces a seed ,and the tree re-emerges
[23:13:52] Bjorn: the 20 trees came forth from the 1st tre like this
[23:14:34] Bjorn: also, human population is low now, most went into space, I'dsay we're at less than one billion
[23:15:30] Alex bond45: Hmmm
[23:15:40] Bjorn: Because of the Husk, it's a world wehere there are no petty criminals. If you want to harm others, you really have to go out of your way to do so and become a supercriminal.
[23:16:08] Bjorn: themain idea is actually a tjough texperiment
[23:16:32] Bjorn: what if we have this future utopia, the best possible we could imagine through technology. Whow wil people live then?
[23:17:28] Bjorn: I think in such a case, the mind, the emotions... that's what people will be living for.
[23:17:54] Bjorn: So, it's less dark than Phantasy star ,actually.
[23:18:05] Bjorn: at least, on the surface of it.
[23:19:11] Alex bond45: Sorry, I've been building my Highlander Team
[23:19:16] Bjorn: heh, ok :)
[23:19:38] Bjorn: did you also see my blog posting?
[23:19:42] Alex bond45: It's a thing for Team Fortress 2, If ya don't know
[23:19:51] Alex bond45: I believe so
[23:20:18] Bjorn: no, I don't know that game. I prefer rpg's over strategy games. It's a matter of taste I guess.
[23:20:52] Alex bond45: Team Fortress 2 is a shooter
[23:20:57] Bjorn: ah, my bad :p
[23:21:16] Bjorn: the last FPS I played was Quake II
[23:21:20] Alex bond45: heheheheh
[23:21:30] Alex bond45: That's an old one
[23:21:35] Bjorn: apert form some open source FPS I just tested a bit, but didn't play thoroughly
[23:21:46] Bjorn: like sauerbraten, etc.
[23:22:33] Bjorn: they'renot really my cup of tea. I prefer classic "fly the plane" based shooters when it comes to pure action games.
[23:25:40] Bjorn: I usually like RPG's since I like a game to have a story too. Also VN's of coure but not so intensvely. Before KS, I played the classic ones from 10-15 years ago.
[23:26:06] Alex bond45: Interesting
[23:26:18] Alex bond45: Sorry, Highlander Teams are irritating to form, I need about 12 people
[23:27:23] Bjorn: I see, I'd like about 12 characters too. 6 men, 6 women, well, 5 men, 5 women 1 female and one male adroid. Yes, they are fully functional and programmed with numerous variations.
[23:32:28] Bjorn: well, I guess that should make a bit more clear what I have been thinking about the last 5 years :)
[23:32:46] Alex bond45: Since KS Was announced?
[23:32:53] Bjorn: yes
[23:33:12] Bjorn: I changd my mind too often though, so  made little progress on the programming
[23:34:13] Bjorn: hmmm I it's good to hear someone else's suggetsions though.
[23:35:14] Bjorn: I just had an idea: two countries that want to fight each other but can't since the system doesn't let them. If they'd stry to start a batlle, the andoids would intervene.
[23:36:00] Bjorn: since war is unhappiness for humans so they can't allow it
[23:37:39] Bjorn: heh, maybe I should listen more and talk less? I'm stll unsure whether I'm not coming off as too arrogant or too pushy.
[23:39:46] Bjorn: well, I think we're almost near the end of our talk today?
[23:39:57] Alex bond45: I'm listening
[23:40:07] Alex bond45: I've been forming the Highlander Team, And It can be hard
[23:40:25] Bjorn: I see, I really don't know that game at all...
[23:41:15] Alex bond45: Basically
[23:41:20] Alex bond45: you have 2 teams in TF2
[23:41:37] Alex bond45: TF2 Has 9 Classes
[23:41:46] Alex bond45: Each team in highlander has 9 people-1 of each class
[23:41:51] Alex bond45: I want 9 people, and 3 fillers
[23:43:43] Bjorn: What are filers. Oh, and I already started to type this: to talk a bit on to how you could help me. I have more or less an idea of the two main characters. Berun, a rather arrogant scholer who was born and raised in Eruta (the country). Chelia, a ssemingly cheerful huntress who came from far away to Eruta to give a new direction to her life.
[23:44:10] Bjorn: I need 10 more characters ... and I'm al out of ideas. :)
[23:44:25] Alex bond45: Fillers are people who are not part of the real team, and take part if 1 person doesnt show up
[23:44:29] Alex bond45: Anyway, Here are my Ideas
[23:44:30] Bjorn: scholer -> scolar
[23:44:43] Alex bond45: Scholar?
[23:45:01] Bjorn: historician, mostly... it's hard to sudy hoistroty if there's so much of it
[23:45:23] Alex bond45: Jackson, the eccentric Engineer who m
