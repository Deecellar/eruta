Songs for Eruta
Copyright Beoran 2013

What could I say 
in praise of love?
When my words float away 
high in the blue.

But quietly
I feel alive
When we walk though the 
forest side by side.

We share warm and deep feelings
mixed with passion and great joy.
Through all our times together
we have forged this precious bond.

What could I say
in praise of you?
I know you are not perfect.
And my heart also grew cold.

But now I find
I always long
To be with you darling.
Nothing else will do.

We share warm and deep feelings
mixed with passion and great joy.
Through all our times together
we have forged this precious bond.

What can I say
I praise of love
Let us live our lives together
as we fly up to the blue.

What can I say
In praise of you?
Give me hundred thousand kisses
and it still won't be enough.

Let's carry on.
Not much to say. 
Let's just keep on loving each other 
every day.
