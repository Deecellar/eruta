1. In Praise Of Love

What could I say 
in praise of love?
When my words float away 
high in the blue.

But quietly
I feel alive
When we walk though the 
forest side by side.

We share warm and deep feelings
mixed with passion and great joy.
Through all our times together
we have forged this precious bond.

What could I say
in praise of you?
I know you are not perfect.
And my heart also grew cold.

But now I find
I always long
To be with you darling.
Nothing else will do.

We share warm and deep feelings
mixed with passion and great joy.
Through all our times together
we have forged this precious bond.

What can I say
I praise of love
Let us live our lives together
as we fly up to the blue.

What can I say
In praise of you?
Give me hundred thousand kisses
and it still won't be enough.

Let's carry on.
Not much to say. 
Let's just keep on loving each other 
every day. 


  



2. Broken

Now I know our hearts are broken,
though we tried hard to mend the wounds,
I will put half the blame on my shoulders,
I was selfish and unkind too. 

Meeting you was a miracle,
And I have no regrets.
But the fact remains: it's over, 
our story came to an end. 






3. Wide

I am young and the world is so bright,
The horizon is wide and clear. 
I will set out to find what I seek,
Ancient knowlegde fogrotten by all

Were did the Travellers go? 
Why don't they send us a sign?
How did the twenty one Trees sprout up?
What did Lord Kei the Rescuer do?

Ref:

I leave my home, my time has come, 
my travels begin now. 
If you want you can come along with me
if you're brave enough to face the truth. 

[Exctatic Backing Vocals:]
Face the truth!
Face the truth!
Face the truth!

[ Instrumental intermezzo ]

The data is endless, obscure,
And no one can make sense of it all.  
I will go where no one has gone.
Do the ruins still hold some clues?

Why does nobody care 
about history anymore?
Even though it has been sixty thousand years 
since mankind first touched the moon. 

I leave my home, my time has come, 
my travels begin now. 
If you want you can come along with me
if you're brave enough to face the truth. 

[Exctatic Backing Vocals + crescendo:]
Backing vocals
Face the truth!
Face the truth!
Face the truth!
Face the truth!
Face the truth!
