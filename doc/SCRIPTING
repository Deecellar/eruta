# Eruta Scripting Documentation

## Introduction

This file contains some documentation on how to use the Eruta engine from the 
scripting side. 

## Engine basics.
The Eruta engine has several elements that can be used to create various 
applications. There is a Graph that can be used to create drawable objects for the 
UI. There is a sprite system that can be used for displaying sprites. There is 
a Store system for loading resources.

One important systems is the tilemap. You can load an arbitrary amount of tile 
maps into the Store systems. However, only one tile map can be active at once. 

Another important system is the Area/Thing system. Things are "in game" objects 
that may or may not have a visual representation. Area is the "in game" "world"
in which these Things exist. Unlike Tilemaps, there is only one Area. When 
switching between tile maps, this same unique Area and all Things in it stay active.
However, it is possible in the script to remove unneeded things (like say, NPC's 
from the old map) or add new things (new NPCS or foes on the new map). The advantage 
of this single Area system is that it's trivial to keep Things that have to stay 
available always, like the PC's in the Area without having to do anything.  

The Area system doesn't even require a tile map to be loaded and/or active, but
of course, no collisions with the "wall" tiles in the map will be possible.
