Katawa Shoujo Review by Beoran.

A free visual novel, and a honest, unique experience.

<b>Introduction</b>
Katawa Shoujo is a free Visual Novel game that was developed by volunteers of the Four Leaf Studio. This rag tag group of people from all over the world, united on internet originally formed on the notourious 4chan image board. A concept drawing named "Katawa Shoujo", Japanese for Crippled Girls,  that presented several of the characters in the game was posted, and finally after much enthusiastic speculation, serveral 
people related to the 4chan board formed the Four Leaf Studio group to create a 
visual novel based on this idea.

For those new to this type of game, a visual novel is an interactive animated
movie. It's much the the video game equivalent of "pick your own story" type 
books. Like in such books, there are large amounts of text to read, and 
occasionally you must make a choice between diferent options that may or may not alter the progress and outcome of the story. 
Unlike the books, of course is the presence of images, sound and music to 
illustrate the text. 

The Four Leaf Studio name is a reference to the ever cheerful and disarming 
Japanese comic character Yotsuba (Japanese for four leavess). 
infamous 4chan image board where the idea of
making a visual novel.

<b>Play Time/Replayability</b>
<b>Slant - 10/10</b> This is a section that most review omit but that is crucial 
try and to keep reviews objective. It's how much I, myself personally enjoyed 
the game. Hoever, more than just enjoy the game, it did something deeper to 
me. Katawa Shojou made me laugh, made me cry, made me realise things I hadn't understood before, it made me sad it, it made me happy, and finally it elated 
me. 
It's been a long time ago that I played a game that affected me on such a 
personal level, and that is why I can only say that I had the hardest time 
in staying objective whilst doing this review. Still, the final score is only a moderate 7/10, since in all honesty I must rate Katawa Shoujou as a game. And
as such, it has it's limitations. Limitations which nevertheless I urge you to 
look beyond.

<b>Final Recommendation</b>
All in all, if you are looking for a game to amuse and entertain you, 
you will find Katawa Shoujo is OK, but not extraorninary either. But if you play 
it with an open mind, and try to discover the wisdom hidden in it, you will see 
that this is more than just a game.
Download it and try it with an open mind. if you're just curious and give it a
spin for a few hours. If you expect this to be a platonic ideal of a Visual 
Novel to best the top commercial ones out there, then you'll be probably 
disappointed. 
But if wou want to play an honest and unique free visual novel, no if you want to experience something pitentially life changing, then by all means  play this 
game I for one, though hope to never forhget the feelings and lessons of Katawa Shoujo, and I wish to carry them flaming in my mind and heart until the day I die.


Memorable Quotes:


"Could you forgive me with a little less force next time?"
"There's no point in apologising for who you are."
"... but there are many, many people who suffer much more than I because of
the way the world is."
"You are a beautif person... so don't apologize for yourself anymore."


Wisdom to be learned:
All in all at the core, we humans want to mean something, to sparkle brightly
once before we are erased from the world for ever. There are many sways that 
seem to lead there, but all in all, our lives can only have that meaning in the 
context of our lives, which is, in the context of others. Just like 
a single word, no matter how beautiful, cannot have a meaning but in a sentence, 
in a text. That is why we are doomed to seek out each other. 
And there lies the tragedy of humanity. We need to communicate with each other, 
but we lack the wisdom to do so. Wisdom, that is, the deep felt expeterience of 
our subconsious mind, where all dreams, feelings and heartfelt descicions come 
from. 
If we lack wisdom we will try to get what we want from others through all 
sorts of misdirected ways. Power, control, bossing over people, normal or 
passive agression, arrogance, aloofness, looking down, locking others out,
persuing pleasures, hiding in our own mind, using and abusing reason and logic,
depencence, money, professionalism, distance...

What is needed in stead is appropriate openness, communication and closeness. 
It's the touch from another heart to our own and from our hearts to that
of others.

Do not hide in your mind, in our own dream world. No atter how marvelous and pleasurable your dreams may be, you are still alone there. Do not follow your passions blindly without regards for others or indeed yourself, what is good for you.
Be passionate, but reasonable. 
Do not think you are a saviour to the other, and do not try to be that. 
To do so is to push the other down in a victim role. It is pity. In stead, 
be attentive, considerate and patient, open your hart and love, support, 
but also  allow yourself to be supported by the other. For there is none alive 
so weak that they cannot mean anything to the other.
One can lve someone one doesn't know. For it is felt from the intuition.


Be ambitious, but in moderion. 
Do not become completely dependent on others, but also, but do not shut out 
others either. Help the other as they help you.
Sex does not comfort in sadness, it only makes bad situations worse.
There is sex without intimacy and intimacy without sex. Apart, the former is pleasurable but not fulfilling, the latter is fulfilling but not pleasurable,
but when both come together, it is the one of the greatest joys in the world.
Sex is not a substitute for closeness.
Think, but not only, for rational tought alone is aloof from reality. It is an abstraction, useful, often reliable, but not the way truly experience life. 
ife is experieced with all our mental facilities. Wordscannot express eveythng, 
thoughts cannot contain everything, memories cannot rememer everything. Only 
direct experience allows life to the fullest. Alone reason is dry and 
lifeless. With the wonder of the dream mind, we can experience so much more. Our feelings, our heart, our are not our ennemies, but like our mind, need to gain experiences to learn, and gain wisdom, and love.
