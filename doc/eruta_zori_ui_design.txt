Design of the Eruta Zori UI Library. 

Goal: Simplified yet complete UI library. 

Ideas:

The UI consists of multiple pages. Only one page can be active at the 
time, however, every page remembers it's last state, and may be visible
under the current active page, if so desired for aestectic or practical
reasons.

The default page is the main UI that is always active for displaying the 
HUD.

Pages may have borders and background colors or images. 

On every page there are one or more controls. Controls are higher level 
divisions of the UI, such as a vertical or horizontal menu, a dialog 
box, a question box, etc. Controls may overlap each other, but only if 
they do not respond to input. Only one control that responds to input 
may be displayed overlapping other non-input controls, this to simplify 
mouse click input.

Controls in tun are made up out of elements. Elements are elementary 
GUI parts such as buttons, labels, images.
