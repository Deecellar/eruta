Eruta, An Action RPG for ADULTS written in Ruby. Some contents may be NSFW.

How to try it:

First of all, the game needs the SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer and SGE libraries.
You have to make sure that you have the development packages installed too.

Then install Ruby 1.9.1 and Ruby/SDL 2.1.0. Get it from here:
http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1006

You also need Chipmunk 4.1.0 . The original version is here:
http://files.slembcke.net/chipmunk/release/

Unfortunately, it doesn't compile on Ruby 1.9.1, so get it here in stead: 
http://github.com/beoran/chipmunk/tree/master/ruby/

Just do 
ruby(1.9) extconf.rb ; make ; make install
and it should work.


Then, check eruta out fom github, and:
cd src
ruby1.9 main.rb

For the map editor:
cd src
ruby1.9 eruma.rb
