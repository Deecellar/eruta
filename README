Eruta, a futuristic jRPG under development.

Requirements:
* OS: Linux for now. Windows port is under development.
* Allegro 5.0.x
* Lua 5.2.x
* Chipmunk 6.x,
* libxml2 (www.xmlsoft.org)
* For testing and compilation: premake4, and valgrind.
* For map editing: tiled (www.mapeditor.org)
* For some of the tools: Ruby.
 
Installation:

You have to make sure that you have all the requirements.  On Linux distributitions like Ubuntu, make sure that the development packages for all requirements are
installed. Then do: 

premake4 gmake ; make

How to try it:

Run bin/eruta from the project's main directory.
Expect to be underwhelmed for now. :-)

As you can see, above, Eruta is licenced under a "Sleepycat license", which is 
GPL compatible, but much shorter and easier to read. Basically you're allowed 
to use the Eruta as you like. However, if you make your own game with Eruta's 
sources, you'll have to make the sources of your program freely available and 
redistributable as well. If you don't like these terms, contact me for making 
different arrangments. :)

Remarks for developers:

bin/mkproto is an automatic function prototype extraction tool that uses ruby. 
It automatically generates .h files for .c files. It extracts the fujnction portotype if the functions hasa comment that starts with /** before it. So 
/** Comment here */ int foo(void) {
  return 0;
}
in the src/foo.c file, wll be extracted to 
/** Comment */ 
int foo(void);
in the include/foo_proto.h file.
That's why there are so many xxx_proto.h files. These are autogenerated. 
The xxx.h files are  semimanual. 

When a new .c file is needed, use the bin/newmodule tool like this
bin/newmodule bar 
and automatically, empty src/bar.c and include/bar.h will be generated.

As for why I use plain C and not, say C++: it's to keep the code simple, tight and focused, and easy to interface wth the Lua scripts. C is a very simple language, but it can do everything. And to save time, quite a bit of the programming will happen on the Lua side.
