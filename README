As you can see, above, Eruta is licenced under a "Sleepycat license", which is 
GPL compatible, but much shorter and easier to read. Basically you're allowed 
to use the Eruta as you like. However, if you make your own game with Eruta's 
sources, you'll have to make the sources of your program freely available and 
redistributable as well. If you don't like these terms, contact me for making 
different arrangments. :)
