Eruta us a futuristic jRPG under development.

Requirements:
* OS: Linux for now. Windows port is under development. OSX may work too.
* Allegro 5.1.5 or later (5.1.5 is in vendor directory). 
  Earlier versions won't be found by the build script.  
* Chipmunk 6.x (see vendor directory).
* libxml2 (www.xmlsoft.org)
* mruby (latest gitub version). To install globally in /usr/local 
  use  
  `cd <directory_where_mruby_is> ; make ; sudo bin/install_mruby`
  to compile and install mruby into /usr/local
* For compilation: cmake 2.8.10.2 or later (see vendor directory), make or ninja.
* For testing and debugging: gdb, ddd, valgrind.
* For map editing: tiled (www.mapeditor.org)
* For some of the tools and continuous testing: Ruby, watchr.
 
Installation:

You have to make sure that you have all the requirements.  On Linux 
distributitions like Ubuntu, make sure that the development packages for all 
requirements are installed. Then do on the command line: 

cmake . ; make

Or if you want to build with Ninja, use the latest version of cmake and go
cmake -G ninja . ; ninja 

How to try it:

Run bin/eruta from the project's main directory.
Expect to be underwhelmed for now. :-)

How to develop using the contious testing script:

Use the supplied watchr script like this:
watchr tool/watchr/eruta_watchr.rb

Every time you change a c file or header, the matching
test will be compiled though cmake and make, and 
will be run. This does compile all C files of eruta,
so it may be a bit slow at times.

How to generate developer's documentation:
Use naturaldocs.

As you can see, above, Eruta is licenced under a "Sleepycat license", which is 
GPL compatible, but much shorter and easier to read. Basically you're allowed 
to use the Eruta as you like. However, if you make your own game with Eruta's 
sources, you'll have to make the sources of your program freely available and 
redistributable as well. If you don't like these terms, contact me for making 
different arrangments. :)

Remarks for developers:

bin/mkproto is an automatic function prototype extraction tool that is 
no longer used due to it being more hassle than help. 

When a new .c file is needed, use the bin/newmodule tool like this
bin/newmodule bar 
and automatically, empty src/bar.c and include/bar.h will be generated.

As for why I use plain C and not, say C++: it's to keep the code simple, tight 
and focused, and easy to interface with the Ruby scripts. C is a very simple
language, but it can do anything and it does it fast. And to save time, quite 
a bit of the programming will happen on the mruby side.

the project. Perhaps I will clean them out some day.. :)
