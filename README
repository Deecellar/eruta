Eruta, An Action RPG in Ruby under development.

Requirements:
* Ruby MRI 1.9.x. Other Rubies untested. 
* SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer 
* For testing: the gems watchr, autowatchr and term-ansicolor.  

Installation:

You have to make sure that you have all the requirements. Install Ruby, 
the SDL libraries, and the testing ruby gems. On Linux distributitions like
Ubuntu, make sure that the development packages for all requirements are
installed as well installed.

When the requirements have been met, you first need to check out eruta
frocompilem github. Then you should insall Gari, my C game programming extension
library. Go to the ext/gari directory and run `ruby extconf.rb` , followed by
`make` and `sudo make install`. If all goes well, this should install the gari
extension in your ruby installation.

How to try it:

Currently I'm in a sort of a spring cleaning with this project, so not
too much works yet. You can run the tests though, by doing 
`watchr test/test.watchr` .
